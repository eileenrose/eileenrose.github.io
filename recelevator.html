  Now suppose we want an elevator that always goes first to the most recent floor that is pressed. This is an example of a Last In First Out (LIFO) queue. How would you change the functions to implement this new behavior?

Test it out with these inputs. Your output should match what you see here.

>var elevatorLine = [];

>currentLine(elevatorLine)
"The line is currently empty"

>pressFloorNumber(elevatorLine, 6)
"Position 1"

>pressFloorNumber(elevatorLine, 3)
"Position 1"

>goToNextFloor(elevatorLine)
"Floor 3"

>pressFloorNumber(elevatorLine, 12)
"Position 1"

>pressFloorNumber(elevatorLine, 5)
"Position 1"

>currentLine(elevatorLine)
"The line is currently: Floor 5, Floor 12, Floor 6"

>goToNextFloor(elevatorLine)
"Floor 5"

>currentLine(elevatorLine)
"The line is currently: Floor 12, Floor 6"

>goToNextFloor(elevatorLine)
"Floor 12"

>goToNextFloor(elevatorLine)
"Floor 6"

>goToNextFloor(elevatorLine)
"There are no more floors to go to!"
Hint

Look up the push and pop methods on JavaScript arrays.
